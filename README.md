# Model-based weighting
This has the codes for the simulation and application study in the model-based weighting paper.

# Installing required software

To run the code you will need to install a special branch of the __rstanarm__ package using the code below. 
This will take several minutes to install because some C++ code needs to be compiled. 

```r
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
  library(devtools)
}
install_github("stan-dev/rstanarm", ref = "structured_prior_merge", args = "--preclean", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```

# Now the structured prior is implemented in the multilevel regression and poststratification interface: https://github.com/mrp-interface/shinymrp
